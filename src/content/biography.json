  "biography": "I'm Carson Herness, and I'm a Wisconsin transplant living in California. I graduate from Harvey Mudd College with a degree in computer science in May 2021, and then I'll be starting as a software engineer at Google on the YouTube team. I enjoy creating projects with React and Firebase in my personal time. Outside of programming, I like to cook, read, crochet, and waste time on the internet."
